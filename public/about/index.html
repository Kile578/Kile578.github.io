    <meta name="description" content="About Kile
Hey there! I&rsquo;m Kile, a 22-year-old Computer Engineering graduate from Northern Arizona University who&rsquo;s passionate about cybersecurity.
My Background

Education: Computer Engineering degree from NAU (2025)
Current Focus: Diving deep into cybersecurity and information security
Interests: Ethical hacking, digital forensics, network security, and emerging cyber threats

Why Cybersecurity?
My journey into cybersecurity started with a conversation with my grandfather and uncle about the future of technology. They emphasized the importance of developing 21st-century skills, and after exploring various tech fields, I discovered that cybersecurity perfectly combines my love for problem-solving with the mathematical precision I prefer over pure coding.">
