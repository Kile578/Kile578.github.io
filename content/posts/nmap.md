## Foundation Knowledge: Why Nmap Matters

### The Manual Approach Problem

Imagine being asked to discover which devices are live on a `192.168.0.1/24` network. The manual approach would involve:
- Using basic tools like `ping` for each of the 254 IP addresses
- Dealing with limitations like firewalls blocking ICMP traffic
- Using `arp-scan` only when connected to the same network
- Manually checking thousands of ports with tools like `telnet`

This approach is incredibly time-consuming and inefficient, which is where Nmap becomes invaluable.

### Enter Nmap: The Network Mapper

Nmap is an open-source network scanner first published in 1997. It's a powerful and flexible tool that can be adapted to various scenarios, solving both host discovery and service detection requirements efficiently.

---

## Task 1: Introduction - Setting the Foundation

### Understanding the Challenge

Two fundamental questions arise when analyzing networks:
1. **Host Discovery**: How can we discover other live devices on this network or other networks?
2. **Service Detection**: How can we find out the network services running on these live devices?

### Learning Objectives Recap

In this room, we learn how to:
- Discover live hosts
- Find running services on the live hosts
- Distinguish the different types of port scans
- Detect the versions of the running services
- Control the timing
- Format the output

### Task Challenge

**Question**: It's time to find out who is listening on the network.

**Answer**: No answer needed

**Key Insight**: This introduction sets the stage for understanding why network reconnaissance is essential and how Nmap solves traditional manual scanning limitations.

---

## Task 2: Host Discovery - Who Is Online

### Understanding Host Discovery

Host discovery is the first step in network reconnaissance - finding out which systems are alive and responsive on a target network before diving into detailed port scanning.

### Target Specification Methods

Nmap offers multiple ways to specify targets:

**IP Range using dash (-):**
```bash
nmap 192.168.0.1-10  # Scans from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.10
```

**IP Subnet using CIDR (/):**
```bash
nmap 192.168.0.1/24  # Scans entire subnet (192.168.0.0-255)
```

**Hostname:**
```bash
nmap example.thm  # Target by hostname
```

### The Ping Scan (-sn)

The `-sn` option performs a ping scan for host discovery without port scanning:
```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.66.0/24
```

### Scanning Local vs Remote Networks

**Local Network Scanning:**
When scanning a directly connected network (Ethernet/WiFi), Nmap uses ARP requests to discover hosts. This provides additional information like MAC addresses and vendor identification.

*Example Output:*
```
Nmap scan report for XiaoQiang (192.168.66.1)
Host is up (0.0069s latency).
MAC Address: 44:DF:65:D8:FE:6C (Unknown)
```

**Remote Network Scanning:**
For networks separated by routers, Nmap cannot use ARP requests. Instead, it uses:
- ICMP echo requests (ping)
- ICMP timestamp requests
- TCP SYN packets to port 443
- TCP ACK packets to port 80

### Additional Discovery Options

**List Scan (-sL):**
```bash
nmap -sL 192.168.0.1/24  # Lists targets without scanning
```

This helps confirm targets before running actual scans.

### Task Challenge

**Question**: What is the last IP address that will be scanned when your scan target is 192.168.0.1/27?

**Answer**: [Your calculation - remember /27 subnet mask]

**Explanation**: [Explain how you calculated the subnet range]

## Task 3: Port Scanning - Who Is Listening

### Understanding Port Scanning

After discovering live hosts, the next step is identifying which network services are listening on these systems. By design, both TCP and UDP have 65,535 ports each.

### TCP Port Scanning Methods

### Connect Scan (-sT)

The connect scan attempts to complete the full TCP three-way handshake:
```bash
nmap -sT target_ip
```

**Characteristics:**
- Completes full TCP handshake
- More likely to be logged by target systems
- Works without root privileges
- Slower than other scan types
- More detectable but reliable

### SYN Scan (-sS) - The Stealth Scan

The SYN scan only sends the first step of the TCP handshake:
```bash
nmap -sS target_ip
```

**Characteristics:**
- Sends only TCP SYN packet
- Never completes the handshake
- More stealthy (fewer logs)
- Requires root privileges
- Faster than connect scans
- Default scan type when running as root

### UDP Scanning (-sU)

UDP scanning targets connectionless UDP services:
```bash
nmap -sU target_ip
```

**Important UDP Services:**
- DNS (port 53)
- DHCP (ports 67/68)
- NTP (port 123)
- SNMP (port 161)
- VoIP services

**Characteristics:**
- More challenging due to UDP's connectionless nature
- Slower than TCP scans
- Often filtered by firewalls
- Essential for complete network assessment

### Limiting Target Ports

**Fast Mode (-F):**
```bash
nmap -F target_ip  # Scans 100 most common ports
```

**Port Range Specification (-p):**
```bash
nmap -p 10-1024 target_ip    # Scan ports 10-1024
nmap -p 80,443,8080 target_ip  # Scan specific ports
nmap -p- target_ip           # Scan all ports (1-65535)
```

### Summary Table

| Option | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| -sT | TCP connect scan – complete three-way handshake |
| -sS | TCP SYN – only first step of the three-way handshake |
| -sU | UDP scan |
| -F | Fast mode – scans the 100 most common ports |
| -p[range] | Specifies a range of port numbers – -p- scans all ports |

### Task Challenges

**Challenge 1: TCP Port Discovery**
*Question*: How many TCP ports are open on the target system at MACHINE_IP?

*Command Used*:
```bash
nmap -sS MACHINE_IP
```

*Answer*: **6**

**Challenge 2: Web Server Discovery**
*Question*: Find the listening web server on MACHINE_IP and access it with your browser. What is the flag that appears on its main page?

*Approach*: [Document your process of finding the web server port and accessing it]

*Answer*: [Your flag discovery]

```bash
nmap -O target_ip
```

*Example Output:*
```
Device type: general purpose
Running: Linux 4.X|5.X
OS details: Linux 4.15 - 5.8
```

### Service and Version Detection (-sV)

Version detection identifies specific service versions running on open ports:
```bash
nmap -sV target_ip
```

*Example Output:*
```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.10
```

### Aggressive Scan (-A)

The `-A` option combines multiple detection methods:
```bash
nmap -A target_ip
```

**Includes:**
- OS detection (-O)
- Service version detection (-sV)
- Traceroute
- Additional scripts and detection methods

### Forcing Scans (-Pn)
